https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS2iCj-HSqY - this is the video that inspired me to create this project. we are working on the high efficiency glide project. focussing on the glider design and solar efficiency, We want to maximize the glide ratio and the solar efficiency.

Glide Ratio = Lift / Drag
Solar Efficiency = Energy Harvested / Energy Consumed

further described here https://eaglepubs.erau.edu/introductiontoaerospaceflightvehicles/chapter/aircraft-stability-control/ https://eaglepubs.erau.edu/introductiontoaerospaceflightvehicles/chapter/gliders-sailplanes/ https://eaglepubs.erau.edu/introductiontoaerospaceflightvehicles/ 

We want to maximize the glide ratio and the solar efficiency.

We will be using the following materials:
- Carbon Fiber
- Kevlar
- Fiberglass
- Carbon Fiber
- Kevlar


the solar cells will be mounted on the top of the glider, and the glider will be designed to maximize the solar efficiency.

We need to design the glider to maximize the glide ratio and the solar efficiency. design the optimal wing shape and size, and the optimal solar cell placement. research the optimal wing shape and size, and the optimal solar cell placement.

create a detailed plan for the glider design and solar efficiency. Create a computer simulation of the glider, to determine the optimal wing shape and size, and the optimal solar cell placement. use real world data & physics to validate the simulation. Ensure the glider is stable and efficient in flight. Formulate tests like turbulence, wind, and other real world conditions to validate the glider.

Make sure to document the process and the results of the project.

Create a report of the project, and the results of the project.

We will be using ardupilot for the flight control system. create integrations between ardupilot and the solar cells, so that the glider can harvest energy from the solar cells and use it to power the flight control system, The goal here is to have a self sustaining glider that can fly autonomously for as long as possible.


Once the glider is designed and built, we will need software to control the glider. we will be using ardupilot for the flight control system. Create test scenarios to validate the flight control system and its logic, to determine if the glider is stable and efficient in flight conditions that are not optimal. Ardupilot will transmit telemetry data to a ground station, so that we can monitor the glider in real time. 

Use a YOLO vision learning model to detect the on screen display elements on the ardupilot control screen, and use the detected elements to control the glider. This will be used to control the glider in situations where the telemetry data is not available, basically it will still use the telemetry data, but recieve it from the on screen display elements and the vision learning models understanding of the screen. Use the flybywire technique to control the glider - and use the vision learning model to improve the flybywire control using the inbuilt camera and vision learning model.

The Vision learning model will need to understand its flight view from a forward camera position, and a bird eye view camera position. The Yolo model will be used in GPS/GNSS denied navigation scenarios to fly through dangerous areas for autonomous landscape and land analysis using safe autonomous solar glider technology, 


We will be using the following software:
- Ardupilot
- Python
- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi
- Jetson Nano
- Nvidia Jetson
